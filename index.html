        <p>Glaswegian old school DIY officials from Nighshift, Hairband, Smack Wizards, Gummy Stumps, Anarchy 99 and Tarantula. Rob
        on electric piano, whistles and vocals; Sephi on bass guitar; and Waldo playing drum kit and singing. Radio Banter are a
        3-piece contemporary pub rock band with original material and textures influenced by rock nature, tradition, the moon
        and a friendly dog. "Never meant to be a real live band", Robert Sotelo cracked open the practice room cocoon about a
        year ago and Radio Banter have been fluttering around the local bars ever since trying to have fun and unlock the
        secrets of music. We have had the pleasure of playing with Cowboy Builder, Lawsuit, 2-ply, R.Aggs, Galoshins,
        Headcleaner. Currently putting tracks together and promising a debut offering of high quality MP3s in time for a
        tour with Sotelo."</p>
