Nature nurture
is it nature is it nurture
this funky feeling that funky beat
is it nature or is it nurture
the reason for this rhythm in my feet
is it nature or is it nurture
people are so angry in the street
is it nature or is it nurture
people are just voting with their feet

don't be rude, don't be rude

is it nature or is it nurture
to argue with your mother's point of view

is it nature or is it nurture
to read beyond the headlines of the news

part of me felt we done too much
part of me felt we never done enough


Growing in love
oh no what to do
i've gone and grown feelings for you
i'm gonna have to
water them now
keep them fed
pull the weeds from
from their bed
give them sunshine
give them shade
use a trowel
use a spade

aw man it's every day
put my shoes on
and it starts to rain
let's see how it looks in an hour

it's not always
the shoots will find their way
it's not always
the shrubs will see the day

oh no what to do
i've grown in love with you


Harsh but fair
people tell me
because of my age
i should reign it in
i should pare it back
people tell me people tell me people tell me

to look out of the window
and what do you see
the war is still raging
there'll never be peace


Richmond
if we don't come off the gas that we emit
and all we do are these carbon offsets
is that really us playing our part
is it wise to be so smart
if we don't just stop oil
the whole sea's gang come to a boil
there'll be mammals washed up on our shores
children seeking refuge at our doors
and they'll be asking why do we only get our bit
once you've taken all the good things out of it

if we don't stop ourselves
we don't leave anybody else
the chance to
the opportunity
not to


End of an era
oops nope we’ll that’s unfortch’
i forgot to pack the propane torch
do you need a good bag from the bakery
before telling us your tales of bravery
stories of old from oh so many years ago
isn’t hindsight a wonderful thing
when one has found one’s flow

the realms in which we are being
sometimes seeing is believing
yet, how can one quell this emotional swell?
please pass the magic potion,
we can cancel out the spell
only time will really tell
could this be
the end of an era?


Ghostie
the moon lit a bed of freshly fell snow
my family slept as i made them soup by the stove
someone's knockin on my door

out there's a young man wearing old man's clothes
he says he lives here and my love is his
i send him walking in the snow man

i can't sleep so i go back outside
where did he come from, which way did he go
there are no footprints in the snow


Doctor
i feel so lazy doctor can you diagnose why
I'll sing anything I got til it gets me a line

I feel so crazy lately are you loving me why
I'll do anything for you papa you gave me my life

oh my god I am so tired
even though I have slept for 12 hours
often that is just what happens
you oversleep and itmakes you more tired
you oversleep and it makes you more tired

jesus christ I am so hungry
gonna go home now I've spent all my money


Instrumental


The groove
you've got to get in to the groove
that's the whole point of this song
this song is so groovy
they're making it in to a movie

so when I die
there will be stars
in the sky
when I die
you've got to get in to the groove


Financial crash
it's all my fault
i took the decision
it's all because of me
it's my responsibility

i need some inspiration
to make a meal
is there any point though
when all you want's a pie
